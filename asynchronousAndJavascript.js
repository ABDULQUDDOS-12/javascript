//hoisting in javascript
//we have creation and execution phase
//hoisting in javascript is a mechanism where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code execute.
console.log(myName)
var myName;
myName = "Abdul Quddos"
//how the creation phase works
//var myName = undefined
//console.log(myName)
//myName = "Abdul Quddos"
//only var is applicable in hoisting part otherwise let and const thows an error
